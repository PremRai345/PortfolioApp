# Portfolio App
It is the Portfolio App made in Flutter. You can learn about basic flutter framework. I have used basic widgets like: Row, Padding, Text, Column. You can also see widgets tree. This app show the basic portfolio. Image is added as profile picture and custom fonts and icons is added. I have used image as background as landscape mode is disabled. User can see the profile name, profile image, descriptions, course studied, email, phone number and location.
